## Troubleshooting

### "npm is not recognized"
- You need to install Node.js first
- After installing, **restart your terminal**
- Try again

### "Port 3000 already in use"
- Another program is using port 3000
- Edit `server.js` and change `const PORT = 3000;` to `const PORT = 3001;`
- Update the mod's `WebsiteAPI.java` to use port 3001

### Website shows no messages
- Check if the server is running (you should see "Server running on..." message)
- Check if the mod is running
- Look at the mod logs for "Sending to website" messages
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Messages go to Discord but not website
- Make sure the website server is running
- The mod sends to BOTH Discord and website
- If website server is off, Discord still works but website won't update

## Alternative: Use start.bat

Just double-click `start.bat` in the website folder!

It will:
1. Install dependencies
2. Start the server
3. Open on http://localhost:3000
